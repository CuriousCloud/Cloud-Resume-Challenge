This Cloud Resume Challenge uses a static website delivered from an S3 bucket using CloudFront and Route 53 for the frontend. The serverless backend consists of an API from API Gateway using a Lambda function to update a DynamoDB database for the resume's visitor counter. Both the frontend and backend are automated with Terraform. Github is used for version control, while Github Actions is used for the CI/CD pipeline. Finally, there's an end to end test performed after deployment with Cypress that verifies the 200 status and body of the lambda response.
